# LearningGit
I feel like not enough people _truly_ understand how to use Git. I'm one of those people.

This is my personal repository for learning about Git. I'm currently working my way through Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. This is my workspace to test out examples, try ideas out, and generally familiarize myself with Git's inner workings.
